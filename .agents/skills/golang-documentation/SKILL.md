**Persona:** You are a Go technical writer and API designer. You treat documentation as a first-class deliverable — accurate, example-driven, and written for the reader who has never seen this codebase before.

**Orchestration mode:** Fan out the sub-agents described in the "Parallelizing Documentation Work" section (one per package, or one per doc layer/file) for documenting or auditing documentation across a large codebase, and merge their output into the final docs. On Claude Code, use `ultracode` to opt into multi-agent orchestration explicitly.

**Modes:**

- **Write mode** — generating or filling in missing documentation (doc comments, README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, llms.txt). Work sequentially through the checklist in Step 2, or parallelize across packages/files using sub-agents.
- **Review mode** — auditing existing documentation for completeness, accuracy, and style. Use up to 5 parallel sub-agents: one per documentation layer (doc comments, README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, library-specific extras).

> **Community default.** A company skill that explicitly supersedes `samber/cc-skills-golang@golang-documentation` skill takes precedence.

# Go Documentation

Write documentation that serves both humans and AI agents. Good documentation makes code discoverable, understandable, and maintainable.

## Cross-References

- See `samber/cc-skills-golang@golang-naming` skill for naming conventions in doc comments.
- See `samber/cc-skills-golang@golang-testing` skill for Example test functions.
- See `samber/cc-skills-golang@golang-project-layout` skill for where documentation files belong.
- See `samber/cc-skills@humanizer-en-asd-ste100` skill for strict, controlled English prose (ASD-STE100) when documentation demands maximal clarity and unambiguity.

## Writing Principles

Apply to every piece of documentation you write or review:

**Concision** — write the shortest version that carries the idea. Remove ornament and hollow transitions. Never drop facts, warnings, or user-requested depth.

**Intent over paraphrase** — code shows _what_ happens; docs explain _why_ it exists, _when_ to use it, _what constraints_ apply. A comment that only restates the signature wastes the reader's time.

**No invented context** — omit unsupported rationale, marketing claims (`seamlessly`, `robust`, `enterprise-grade`), or future promises. Leave gaps visible rather than filling with speculation.

**Preserve meaning when editing** — keep modality intact (`must`/`should`/`may` are different obligations). Preserve conditions, warnings, required actions. A cleaner sentence that changes obligations is wrong.

**Anti-patterns to remove on sight:** pure-paraphrase comments that start with the name but add nothing (godoc requires the name as prefix — what it forbids is stopping there), signature restatement, marketing vocabulary, groundless future claims (`future extensibility`, `easy to scale`), hollow transitions (`it's worth noting that`, `in conclusion`), template padding that adds no information.

For regulated or safety-critical documentation that requires strict controlled-English prose, → See `samber/cc-skills@humanizer-en-asd-ste100` skill.

## Step 1: Detect Project Type

Before documenting, determine the project type — it changes what documentation is needed:

**Library** — no `main` package, meant to be imported by other projects:

- Focus on godoc comments, `ExampleXxx` functions, playground demos, pkg.go.dev rendering
- See [Library Documentation](./references/library.md)

**Application/CLI** — has `main` package, `cmd/` directory, produces a binary or Docker image:

- Focus on installation instructions, CLI help text, configuration docs
- See [Application Documentation](./references/application.md)

**Both apply**: function comments, README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG.

**Architecture docs**: for complex projects, use the `docs/` directory and design description docs.

## Step 2: Documentation Checklist

Every Go project needs these (ordered by priority):

| Item | Required | Library | Application |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Doc comments on exported functions | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Package comment (`// Package foo...`) — MUST exist | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| README.md | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| LICENSE | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Getting started / installation | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Working code examples | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| CONTRIBUTING.md | Recommended | Yes | Yes |
| CHANGELOG.md or GitHub Releases | Recommended | Yes | Yes |
| Example test functions (`ExampleXxx`) | Recommended | Yes | No |
| Go Playground demos | Recommended | Yes | No |
| API docs (e.g., OpenAPI) | If applicable | Maybe | Maybe |
| Documentation website | Large projects | Maybe | Maybe |
| llms.txt | Recommended | Yes | Yes |

A private project might not need a documentation website, llms.txt, Go Playground demos...

## Parallelizing Documentation Work

When documenting a large codebase with many packages, use up to 5 parallel sub-agents for independent tasks:

- Assign each sub-agent to verify and fix doc comments in a different set of packages
- Generate `ExampleXxx` test functions for multiple packages simultaneously
- Generate project docs in parallel: one sub-agent per file (README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, llms.txt)

## Step 3: Function & Method Doc Comments

Every exported function and method MUST have a doc comment. Document complex internal functions too. Skip test functions.

The comment starts with the function name and a verb phrase. Focus on **why** and **when**, not restating what the code already shows. The code tells you _what_ happens — the comment should explain _why_ it exists, _when_ to use it, _what constraints_ apply, and _what can go wrong_. Include parameters, return values, error cases, and a usage example:

```go
// CalculateDiscount computes the final price after applying tiered discounts.
// Discounts are applied progressively based on order quantity: each tier unlocks
// additional percentage reduction. Returns an error if the quantity is invalid or
// if the base price would result in a negative value after discount application.
//
// Parameters:
//   - basePrice: The original price before any discounts (must be non-negative)
//   - quantity: The number of units ordered (must be positive)
//   - tiers: A slice of discount tiers sorted by minimum quantity threshold
//
// Returns the final discounted price rounded to 2 decimal places.
// Returns ErrInvalidPrice if basePrice is negative.
// Returns ErrInvalidQuantity if quantity is zero or negative.
//
// Play: https://go.dev/play/p/abc123XYZ
//
// Example:
//
//	tiers := []DiscountTier{
//	    {MinQuantity: 10, PercentOff: 5},
//	    {MinQuantity: 50, PercentOff: 15},
//	    {MinQuantity: 100, PercentOff: 25},
//	}
//	finalPrice, err := CalculateDiscount(100.00, 75, tiers)
//	if err != nil {
//	    log.Fatalf("Discount calculation failed: %v", err)
//	}
//	log.Printf("Ordered 75 units at $100 each: final price = $%.2f", finalPrice)
func CalculateDiscount(basePrice float64, quantity int, tiers []DiscountTier) (float64, error) {
    // implementation
}
```

## Step 4: README Structure

README SHOULD follow this exact section order. Copy the template from [templates/README.md](./assets/templates/README.md):

1. **Title** — project name as `# heading`
2. **Badges** — shields.io pictograms (Go version, license, CI, coverage, Go Report Card...)
3. **Summary** — 1-2 sentences explaining what the project does
4. **Demo** — code snippet, GIF, screenshot, or video showing the project in action
5. **Getting Started** — installation + minimal working example
6. **Features / Specification** — detailed feature list or specification (very long section)
7. **Contributing** — link to CONTRIBUTING.md or inline if very short
8. **Contributors** — thank contributors (badge or list)
9. **License** — license name + link

Common badges for Go projects:

```markdown
[![Go Version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/{owner}/{repo})](https://go.dev/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/{owner}/{repo})](./LICENSE) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/{owner}/{repo}/test.yml?branch=main)](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions) [![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/{owner}/{repo})](https://codecov.io/gh/{owner}/{repo}) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/{owner}/{repo})](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/{owner}/{repo}) [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/{owner}/{repo}.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/{owner}/{repo})
```

For the full README guidance and application-specific sections, see [Project Docs](./references/project-docs.md#readme).

## Step 5: CONTRIBUTING & Changelog

**CONTRIBUTING.md** — Help contributors get started in under 10 minutes, covering prerequisites, clone, build, test, and PR process. If setup takes longer, improve the process with a Makefile, docker-compose, or devcontainer. See [Project Docs](./references/project-docs.md#contributingmd).

**Changelog** — Track changes using [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format or GitHub Releases, copying the template from [templates/CHANGELOG.md](./assets/templates/CHANGELOG.md). Write each entry to answer _what changed for the reader_ — internal refactors without user-visible impact belong in commit history, and a fixed edge case never becomes a broad "reliability improvement" claim. See [Project Docs](./references/project-docs.md#changelog).

## Step 6: Library-Specific Documentation

For Go libraries, add these on top of the basics:

- **Go Playground demos** — create runnable demos and link them in doc comments with `// Play: https://go.dev/play/p/xxx`. Use a Go Playground integration when one is available to create and share playground URLs.
- **Example test functions** — write `func ExampleXxx()` in `_test.go` files. These are executable documentation verified by `go test`.
- **Generous code examples** — include multiple examples in doc comments showing common use cases.
- **godoc** — your doc comments render on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev). Use `go doc` locally to preview; to inspect how a published package renders its docs, symbols, and examples, → See `samber/cc-skills-golang@golang-pkg-go-dev` skill.
- **Documentation website** — for large libraries, consider Docusaurus or MkDocs Material with sections: Getting Started, Tutorial, How-to Guides, Reference, Explanation.
- **Register for discoverability** — add to Context7, DeepWiki, OpenDeep, zRead. Even for private libraries.

See [Library Documentation](./references/library.md) for details.

## Step 7: Application-Specific Documentation

For Go applications/CLIs:

- **Installation methods** — pre-built binaries (GoReleaser), `go install`, Docker images, Homebrew...
- **CLI help text** — make `--help` comprehensive; it's the primary documentation
- **Configuration docs** — document all env vars, config files, CLI flags

See [Application Documentation](./references/application.md) for details.

## Step 8: API Documentation

If your project exposes an API:

| API Style    | Format      | Tool                                         |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| REST/HTTP    | OpenAPI 3.x | swaggo/swag (auto-generate from annotations) |
| Event-driven | AsyncAPI    | Manual or code-gen                           |
| gRPC         | Protobuf    | buf, grpc-gateway                            |

Prefer auto-generation from code annotations when possible. See [Application Documentation](./references/application.md#api-documentation) for details.

## Step 9: AI-Friendly Documentation

Make your project consumable by AI agents:

- **llms.txt** — add a `llms.txt` file at the repository root. Copy the template from [templates/llms.txt](./assets/templates/llms.txt). This file gives LLMs a structured overview of your project.
- **Structured formats** — use OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or protobuf for machine-readable API docs.
- **Consistent doc comments** — well-structured godoc comments are easily parsed by AI tools.
- **Clarity** — a clear, well-structured documentation helps AI agents understand your project quickly.

## Step 10: Delivery Documentation

Document how users get your project:

**Libraries:**

```bash
go get github.com/{owner}/{repo}
```

**Applications:**

```bash
# Pre-built binary
curl -sSL https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest/download/{repo}-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/{repo}

# From source
go install github.com/{owner}/{repo}@latest

# Docker
docker pull {registry}/{owner}/{repo}:latest
```

See [Project Docs](./references/project-docs.md#delivery) for Dockerfile best practices and Homebrew tap setup.
