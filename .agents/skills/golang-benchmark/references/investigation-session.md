## Setting Up a Session

Before diving into profiles, set up the environment to collect high-resolution data:

1. **Reduce Prometheus scrape interval** to <=10s on the target instance (normally 15-30s). More data points during a short investigation window reveal patterns that 30s intervals miss. Revert after investigation.

2. **Enable pprof** via environment variable — no recompile needed:

   ```bash
   kubectl set env deployment/my-service PPROF_ENABLED=true
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/my-service
   ```

3. **Enable continuous profiling** on the target instance only — not fleet-wide. Pyroscope/Parca on a single instance is manageable; on 50 replicas it overwhelms the backend.

   ```bash
   kubectl set env deployment/my-service PYROSCOPE_ENABLED=true
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/my-service
   ```

4. **Enable debug logging** via env var if needed — but only on the target instance. Debug logging has significant throughput impact:

   ```bash
   kubectl set env deployment/my-service LOG_LEVEL=debug
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/my-service
   ```

**Key principle:** all costly debug features (pprof HTTP, continuous profiling, debug log level, trace collection) SHOULD be configurable via environment variables. This allows instant toggle without recompile. Design your application to support this from day one.

## Prometheus Go Runtime Collector

The `prometheus/client_golang` library automatically registers collectors that expose Go runtime metrics. These are invaluable during investigation sessions — they provide a time-series view of memory, GC, goroutines, and CPU that complements point-in-time profiles.

When using `prometheus/client_golang`, refer to the library's official documentation to verify collector setup and available options.

### Key Series

→ See [prometheus-go-metrics.md](./prometheus-go-metrics.md) for the **exhaustive reference** of all Go runtime metrics (verified from official sources). **Note:** runtime/metrics list varies by Go version — use `metrics.All()` at runtime for your specific Go version.

**Performance note:** `go_memstats_*` metrics internally call `runtime.ReadMemStats()`, which triggers a short stop-the-world pause. In Go 1.17+, the runtime/metrics collector (`collectors.NewGoCollector()`) uses `runtime/metrics` instead, which is cheaper. Prefer the modern collector in high-throughput services:

```go
import "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/collectors"

// Use runtime/metrics-based collector (lower overhead)
reg := prometheus.NewRegistry()
reg.MustRegister(collectors.NewGoCollector(
    collectors.WithGoCollectorRuntimeMetrics(collectors.MetricsAll),
))
reg.MustRegister(collectors.NewProcessCollector(collectors.ProcessCollectorOpts{}))
```

## PromQL Deep-Dive Queries

Use these during investigation sessions with the reduced scrape interval. Each query includes what to look for and what the result means.

### GC pressure

| PromQL | What to look for |
| --- | --- |
| `rate(go_gc_duration_seconds_count[5m])` | GC cycles/s. >2/s sustained = excessive allocation rate. Reduce allocations per request. |
| `rate(go_gc_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) / rate(go_gc_duration_seconds_count[5m])` | Average GC pause. Increasing trend = heap growing or too many pointers to scan. |
| `go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="1"}` | Worst-case GC pause. Spikes here cause tail latency (P99). |

### Memory leak detection

| PromQL | What to look for |
| --- | --- |
| `go_memstats_alloc_bytes` | Should be roughly stable under constant load. Continuous increase = memory leak. |
| `rate(go_memstats_alloc_bytes_total[5m])` | Allocation rate (bytes/s). Compare before/after deploy — significant increase = new allocation pattern. |
| `process_resident_memory_bytes - go_memstats_sys_bytes` | Gap = non-Go memory (cgo, mmap). Growing gap = non-Go leak. |

### Goroutine leak detection

| PromQL | What to look for |
| --- | --- |
| `go_goroutines` | Should correlate with load. Growing independently of traffic = leak. |
| `delta(go_goroutines[1h])` | Net goroutine change over 1h. Positive without load increase = leak. |

### CPU saturation

| PromQL | What to look for |
| --- | --- |
| `rate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m])` | CPU cores consumed. Compare to GOMAXPROCS. |
| `rate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m]) / <GOMAXPROCS>` | CPU utilization ratio. >0.8 sustained = CPU-saturated. |

### Post-deploy regression detection

| PromQL | What to look for |
| --- | --- |
| `rate(go_memstats_alloc_bytes_total[5m])` | Compare before/after deploy window. Significant increase = new allocation pattern introduced. |
| `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))` | P99 latency increase after deploy = performance regression. Requires app-level histogram. |

### Example alerting rules

```yaml
# GC taking too much time
- alert: HighGCPauseTime
  expr: rate(go_gc_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) / rate(go_gc_duration_seconds_count[5m]) > 0.01
  for: 10m
  annotations:
    summary: "Average GC pause >10ms — reduce allocations or tune GOGC"

# Goroutine leak
- alert: GoroutineLeak
  expr: go_goroutines > 10000
  for: 5m
  annotations:
    summary: "Goroutine count >10K — check for leaked goroutines"

# Memory approaching container limit
- alert: MemoryNearLimit
  expr: predict_linear(process_resident_memory_bytes[1h], 3600) > <container_limit_bytes>
  for: 15m
  annotations:
    summary: "RSS projected to exceed container limit within 1h"
```

Adjust thresholds to your application — a data pipeline has different baselines than an API server.

## Host-Level Correlation

Go runtime metrics alone don't show the full picture. Host-level metrics reveal whether the problem is in your application or the infrastructure.

- **`node_exporter`** — host CPU, memory, disk I/O, network. Correlate with Go app metrics: high `node_cpu_seconds_total` with low `process_cpu_seconds_total` = noisy neighbor, not your app.
- **`process-exporter`** — per-process metrics on Linux. Useful when multiple Go services share a host.

## Cost Warnings

**Profiles and traces are expensive to collect.** Keep them short-term and localized:

- **pprof CPU profiling** — CPU-intensive during the capture window. Don't run 30s profiles back-to-back in production. Space them out.
- **Pyroscope continuous profiling** — ~2-5% CPU overhead **per instance, always-on**. At scale (hundreds of instances), this adds up in compute cost and backend storage. Enable on a subset of instances or on-demand via environment variable. → See `samber/cc-skills-golang@golang-observability` skill for Pyroscope setup.
- **Execution traces** — generate large files quickly (MB/s). Capture 5-10s max. Longer traces are unwieldy and slow to analyze.
- **Debug log level** — significant throughput impact due to allocation and I/O overhead. Never leave on permanently.
- **All costly features** SHOULD be toggleable via environment variables for instant on/off without recompile. Design for this from day one.
