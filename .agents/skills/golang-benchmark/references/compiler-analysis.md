# Compiler Analysis Reference

The Go compiler provides diagnostic flags that reveal optimization decisions — escape analysis, inlining, SSA intermediate representation, and generated assembly. These are essential for understanding **why** a function allocates or **why** the compiler won't inline it.

Use compiler diagnostics when pprof shows a hot function and you need to understand the compiler's decisions about that function. These tools are free (no runtime overhead) — they analyze at compile time.

## Escape Analysis

Escape analysis determines whether a variable can live on the stack (cheap — freed when the function returns) or must be allocated on the heap (expensive — requires GC). "Moved to heap" means the compiler decided the variable might outlive the function.

### Commands

```bash
# Show escape decisions — one line per escaped variable
go build -gcflags="-m" ./... 2>&1 | grep "escapes to heap"
go build -gcflags="-m" ./... 2>&1 | grep "moved to heap"

# Verbose mode — shows the reason for each escape decision
go build -gcflags="-m -m" ./...

# Filter to a specific package
go build -gcflags="-m" ./pkg/parser 2>&1 | grep "escapes"

# Filter to a specific file
go build -gcflags="-m" ./pkg/parser/parse.go 2>&1

# Apply to all dependencies too (usually too noisy, but useful for debugging)
go build -gcflags="all=-m" ./...

# Combine with grep for a specific function
go build -gcflags="-m" ./pkg/parser 2>&1 | grep "Parse"

# Combine with grep to see what stays on the stack (does NOT escape)
go build -gcflags="-m" ./pkg/parser 2>&1 | grep "does not escape"
```

### Reading the output

```
./pkg/parser/parse.go:15:6: can inline Parse
./pkg/parser/parse.go:42:13: &result escapes to heap
./pkg/parser/parse.go:42:13:   flow: ~r0 = &result:
./pkg/parser/parse.go:42:13:     from &result (address-of) at ./pkg/parser/parse.go:42:13
./pkg/parser/parse.go:42:13:     from return &result (return) at ./pkg/parser/parse.go:42:6
```

The `-m -m` (verbose) output shows the **escape chain** — why the compiler decided the variable escapes. In this example: `result` has its address taken (`&result`), and that pointer is returned, so `result` must survive beyond the function — it escapes to heap.

### Common escape causes

| Cause | Example | Why it escapes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Returning a pointer to a local** | `return &result` | The local must outlive the function call — caller holds a reference |
| **Interface boxing** | `var x any = myStruct` | Concrete type stored in `interface{}` allocates a copy on the heap |
| **Closure capturing a local** | `go func() { use(localVar) }()` | The goroutine may run after the enclosing function returns |
| **Slice append beyond capacity** | `s = append(s, item)` when len == cap | Triggers a new backing array allocation on the heap |
| **Passing pointer to unanalyzable function** | `json.Marshal(&data)` | Compiler can't prove the pointer won't be retained across package boundary |
| **Storing in a struct field that escapes** | `obj.Field = &local` | If `obj` is heap-allocated, anything it points to must also be on the heap |
| **fmt.Sprintf and friends** | `fmt.Sprintf("%d", n)` | Arguments are boxed into `any` (interface boxing) + result string is heap-allocated |
| **Sending pointer on channel** | `ch <- &data` | Channel receiver may be a different goroutine with a different lifetime |

**Not all escapes are problems.** Only investigate escapes in functions that pprof identifies as allocation-heavy. A function called once at startup can escape freely.

## Inlining Decisions

Inlining replaces a function call with the function body at the call site. This eliminates call overhead and enables further optimizations (escape analysis improves, dead code elimination, constant folding). Functions that aren't inlined in hot paths may benefit from simplification.

### Commands

```bash
# Show which functions CAN be inlined
go build -gcflags="-m" ./... 2>&1 | grep "can inline"

# Show which functions CANNOT be inlined (with the reason)
go build -gcflags="-m" ./... 2>&1 | grep "cannot inline"

# Show inlining decisions for a specific package
go build -gcflags="-m" ./pkg/handler 2>&1 | grep "inline"

# Show where inlining was actually applied (function was inlined into caller)
go build -gcflags="-m" ./... 2>&1 | grep "inlining call to"

# Verbose mode — shows the cost budget and why inlining was blocked
go build -gcflags="-m -m" ./... 2>&1 | grep "inline"

# Filter to a specific function
go build -gcflags="-m" ./pkg/handler 2>&1 | grep "HandleRequest"

# Show both inlining and escape analysis together (they interact)
go build -gcflags="-m" ./pkg/handler 2>&1 | grep -E "(inline|escape|moved to heap)"
```

### Reading the output

```
./pkg/handler/handler.go:20:6: can inline validateInput
./pkg/handler/handler.go:35:6: cannot inline HandleRequest: function too complex: cost 120 exceeds budget 80
./pkg/handler/handler.go:42:19: inlining call to validateInput
```

The inline cost budget is approximately 80–82 AST nodes (as of Go 1.22+; has increased in later releases). Functions with higher cost (more AST nodes, complex control flow) are not inlined. Check the actual threshold with `-gcflags="-m -m"`.

### Common inlining blockers

| Blocker | Why it prevents inlining | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Function too complex** | Body cost exceeds budget (80) | Split into smaller functions; extract the cold path |
| **`defer` statement** | Adds cleanup code that complicates inlining | Remove `defer` from tiny hot functions; call cleanup directly |
| **`recover()` call** | Forces stack frame preservation | Move `recover()` to a wrapper function |
| **`go` statement** | Goroutine launch has implicit complexity | Extract goroutine body into a separate function |
| **Type switch / interface method call** | Dynamic dispatch can't be resolved at compile time | Use concrete types in hot paths |
| **`select` statement** | Complex runtime interaction | Simplify channel patterns in hot functions |
| **Large function body** | Many statements add up in cost | Break into smaller functions — the hot inner function may inline |

**Value receivers vs pointer receivers:** Receiver choice can affect copying, aliasing, escape analysis, and inlining, but pointer receiver methods can inline too and value receivers do not guarantee inlining. Check real compiler decisions with `-gcflags="-m -m"`.

## SSA Dump

The SSA (Static Single Assignment) dump shows the compiler's intermediate representation after each optimization pass — dead code elimination, bounds check removal, constant folding, register allocation. Use this when you need to understand exactly what the compiler generates.

### Commands

```bash
# Generate SSA dump for a specific function — creates ssa.html in current directory
GOSSAFUNC=Parse go build ./pkg/parser
# Open ssa.html in browser — shows each optimization pass side by side

# Generate for a method on a type
GOSSAFUNC='(*Parser).Parse' go build ./pkg/parser

# Generate for a function in a specific package (when names collide)
GOSSAFUNC=myapp/pkg/parser.Parse go build ./...

# Combine with a specific output directory
GOSSAFUNC=Parse GOSSADIR=/tmp/ssa go build ./pkg/parser
# Creates /tmp/ssa/ssa.html
```

### Reading ssa.html

The HTML file shows the function's code at each compiler pass:

1. **Source** — original Go code
2. **AST** — abstract syntax tree
3. **Start** — initial SSA form
4. **Opt** — after optimization passes (dead code, constant prop, bounds check elimination)
5. **Lower** — architecture-specific lowering
6. **Regalloc** — after register allocation
7. **Genssa** — final generated code

Click on a value in any pass to highlight it across all passes — see how the compiler transforms it. Red values were eliminated (dead code). Green values are new (introduced by a pass).

**What to look for:**

- **Bounds checks remaining** — `IsInBounds` or `IsSliceInBounds` operations that weren't eliminated. Adding explicit bounds checks or using `_ = s[n-1]` hints can help
- **Dead code not eliminated** — values computed but never used (should be eliminated; if not, check for side effects)
- **Constant folding** — computations on constants should be resolved at compile time
- **Register spills** — values moved to stack because not enough registers; indicates heavy register pressure

## Assembly Output

View the actual machine code the compiler generates. Use for verifying SIMD instructions, bounds checks, register allocation, and micro-optimization decisions.

### Commands

```bash
# Full assembly output for a package (very verbose)
go build -gcflags="-S" ./pkg/parser 2>&1 | head -200

# Assembly for a specific function (grep for the function name)
go build -gcflags="-S" ./pkg/parser 2>&1 | grep -A 50 '"".Parse'

# Assembly for all packages (including dependencies — very verbose)
go build -gcflags="all=-S" ./... 2>&1 | grep -A 50 'myapp/pkg/parser.Parse'

# Disassemble a compiled binary (alternative to -gcflags="-S")
go build -o myapp ./cmd/server
go tool objdump -s Parse myapp

# Disassemble with source interleaving
go tool objdump -S -s Parse myapp

# Disassemble a specific symbol
go tool objdump -s 'myapp/pkg/parser.Parse' myapp

# Disassemble a specific text range (by address)
go tool objdump -start 0x4a3b00 -end 0x4a3c00 myapp

# List all symbols in a binary
go tool nm myapp | grep Parse

# Cross-compile and inspect assembly for a different architecture
GOARCH=arm64 go build -gcflags="-S" ./pkg/parser 2>&1 | head -200
```

### Reading assembly output

```asm
"".Parse STEXT size=240 args=0x18 locals=0x48
    0x0000 MOVQ (TLS), CX           ; goroutine stack check
    0x0009 LEAQ -64(SP), AX
    0x000e CMPQ AX, 16(CX)          ; stack overflow check
    0x0012 JLS  228                  ; jump to stack growth
    0x0018 SUBQ $72, SP             ; allocate stack frame
    0x001c MOVQ BP, 64(SP)          ; save base pointer
    0x0021 LEAQ 64(SP), BP          ; set new base pointer
    ; ... function body ...
    0x00e0 CALL runtime.makeslice(SB) ; heap allocation!
```

**What to look for:**

- `CALL runtime.makeslice` or `CALL runtime.newobject` — heap allocations in the hot path
- `CALL runtime.growslice` — slice capacity exceeded, triggering copy
- `PCDATA` / `FUNCDATA` — GC metadata (ignore for performance analysis)
- Bounds check sequences: `CMPQ` + `JCC` before array/slice access — can sometimes be eliminated
- SIMD instructions: `VMOVDQU`, `VPSHUFB`, `VPADDB`, etc. — verify auto-vectorization or manual SIMD
- `CALL runtime.morestack_noctxt` — stack growth (normal, but frequent calls indicate deep recursion)
